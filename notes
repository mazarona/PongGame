1) Make the ball (initialize its struct)
2) Update the ball
3) Render the ball

GameObjects.c
    makeCircle
    makeRectangle
    makeTriangle
    makeLine
    makeBall
    NOTE: Each object will have-besides x y size speed attributes- a pointer to its update function set by the user of my lib
GameLoop.c
    Draw all of the objects
    void startGame(void);
