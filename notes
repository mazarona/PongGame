1) Make the ball (initialize its struct)
2) Update the ball
3) Render the ball (by calling the renderer fill rect command)

GameObjects.c
    makeCircle
    makeRectangle
    makeTriangle
    makeLine
    makeBall
    NOTE: Each object will have-besides x y size speed attributes- a pointer to its update function set by the user of my lib
GameLoop.c
    Draw all of the objects
    void startGame(void);


TODO:
    -> Use an appropriate datastructure instead of linked lists to keep track of my non-homogeneous game objects.
    -> Implement a new vector2D  datatype to hold position, velocity and force.

NOTES:
    -> The linked list is defined in GameObjects.c (makes sense)
    -> It is declared as extern in GameLoop.c (to update the objects inside of it before render)
    -> It is declared as extern in init.c (to destroy the list at shutdown and avoid memory leak)
